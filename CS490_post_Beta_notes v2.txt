CS490 Post Beta Notes (areas that needs modification for Release Candidate)

Logging in:
-The system should know who you are logging in as, whether you're a student or professor. 
You shouldn't need to specify

Question bank:
-maybe filter by topic and question.
-three levels of difficulty and topic (examples. conditional, for/loop)
-Split screen for creating question to see what is being created against what exists

Making an exam:
-also, may need split screen
-Needs filtering for managing question. Also, ability to tweak points.
-some questions may worth more than others
-question table will need level of difficulty and topic
-Time isn't necessarily needed

Taking a exam:
-function name and parameters shouldn't be displayed since it's too obvious
-also, student should see how much points a question is worth
-confirmation of submitting an exam after it is taken

Autograding:
-Have a timeout so that none of the answer is running in an infinite loop.
-show points for test cases.

Professor releasing score:
-see a preview of what the autograding is and then be able to tweak the grade and comments
-(must before the score is released)
-can be per student or all students (will leave as open ended for now)

Student viewing grade:
-state why the points is deducted in the autograding
-each test case is worth so many points to be displayed
